          Refer preprocess
          Raw hit counter
          Team engagement booster by having their own refer links
          Hourly stats are also easy now
               Update the hr count (more granular is anyways stored in rawdata)
          createrefer - secret=$val+hr, refer=$val   
               Only allow n refers per minute/day from an IP
               Meta - start, campaign type (dropdown), other details
               Check if exists
               Be creative [ any set of numbers, letters (english), -, underscore should work]
          /refer- Allow people to create referral link with threshold [ will look bad]
               So do not process people refers upfront. NO
               How do we ensure we are not spammed. We are opening up to the world, we need limits
               Throttle with IP and let user request more refers or tell them to come back after n units of time
          /myrefer
               Search by refer
